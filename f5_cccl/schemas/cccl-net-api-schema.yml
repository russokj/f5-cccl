  The CCCL "Cecil" library allows clients to define services that describe
  NET resources on a managed partition of the BIG-IP.  The managed resources
  are defined in this schema definitions section.
  The structure of the service definition is a collection of lists of
  supported resources.  Initially this is ARPs and FDB tunnel records.
  Where appropriate some basic constraints are defined by the schema; however,
  not all actual constraints can be enforced by the schema.  It is the
  responsibility of the client application to ensure that all dependencies
  among the specified resources are met; otherwise, the service will be deployed
  in a degraded state.
