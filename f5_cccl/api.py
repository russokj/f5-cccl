    The F5 Common Controller Core Library (CCCL) is an orchestration package

    in diverse environments (e.g. Marathon, Kubernetes, OpenStack). The
    API will allow a user to create proxy services by specifying the:
    virtual servers, pools, L7 policy and rules, monitors, arps, or fdbTunnels
    as a service description object.  Each instance of the CCCL is initialized
    with namespace qualifiers to allow it to uniquely identify the resources
    under its control.
